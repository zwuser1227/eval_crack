#Eval
An implementation of code for crack detection and segmentation evaluation.
#Illustrate
The evaluation code is sourced from the repository [DeepSegmentor](https://github.com/yhlleo/DeepSegmentor)(really thanks for that). The testing results of our method, as well as those of the comparison methods, were all obtained using this evaluation code.
For detailed instructions and an introduction, please refer to [DeepSegmentor](https://github.com/yhlleo/DeepSegmentor).
